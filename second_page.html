                    It’s also called mochaccino or mocha latte. Its name comes from the city of Mocha (or al-Makha) in
                    Yemen which was the major marketplace for coffee from the 15th century until the 18th century.

                    An Americano is an espresso drink made with hot water and espresso, also called a Caffe Americano.
                    The drink can be made with either one or two shots of espresso, and varying ratios of water.
                    Diluting the strong dark espresso roast brings the flavor closer to a drip coffee: which might be
                    where the name originated!

                    Frappe originated in Greece and is made with instant coffee, sugar, water, and milk blended together
                    with ice, while Frappuccino is a trademarked iced coffee beverage sold by Starbucks which consists
                    of espresso shots, milk, and sweeteners blended with ice.
                    Frappuccinos tend to be sweeter than frappes due to the use of flavored syrups and whipped cream
                    toppings, while frappes tend to be sweeter than Frappuccinos, but have a stronger coffee flavor.

                    cream or flavored syrups for an extra indulgent treat.

                    Mazagran (also called café mazagran, formerly spelled masagran) is a cold, sweetened coffee drink
                    that originated in Algeria.Portuguese versions may use espresso, lemon, mint and rum, and Austrian
                    versions are served with an ice cube and include rum. Sometimes a fast version is achieved by
                    pouring a previously sweetened espresso in a cup with ice cubes and a slice of lemon. Mazagran has
                    been described as "the original iced coffee".
